# Personalized Calculator - Product Requirements
### Modes
1. The calculator offers two modes:
    * Standard calculation
    * Currency conversion
1. The user can switch modes using tabs placed at the top-most area of the calculator
1. The tabs are named "CALC" (left tab) and "CONVERT" (right tab)
1. A tab content is composed of two sections (ordered vertically):
    * Display section - panel(s) displaying the expression(s)
    * Button section - contains the tab buttons
1. Each tab contains different looking sections, as described below

    ### Buttons
1. The buttons are divided to 3 groups:
    1. **Display-only**  
        1. Clear ("C")  
        Sets the expression to "0"
        1. Delete ("ðŸ ”")  
        Deletes the last character of the expression. Sets "0" when clicked with expression of length 1
        1. Result ("=")  
        Calculates the expression result. Does nothing if the expression is invalid
    
    1. **Operators**
        * Add ("+")
        * Subtract ("-")
        * Multiply ("Ã—")
        * Divide ("Ã·")
        * Dot (".")
        <br/>
        a. Two consecutive operators can't appear in the display panel.
        <br/>
        b. Clicking the same operator multiple times in a row adds only one operator to the end of the expression.
        <br/>
        c. Clicking different operators in a row replaces the previous operator with the new one.
        
    1. **Numbers**
        * 0 to 9
        * Open parentheses - "("
        * Close parentheses - ")"
        <br/>
